# Hybrid-Images
Hybrid two pictures, with one in a high frequency while another one in a low frequency.

In this code, for example, I use two pictures of myself to combine. An important thing is thant these two pictures are better have similar center of people or objects and similar color is also good. If we do have those two similar pictures, the result will be perfect to see only high frequency one when we take a close look, and low freqency one when we look at it in steps.
